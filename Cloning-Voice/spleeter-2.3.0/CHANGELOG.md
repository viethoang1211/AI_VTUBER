# Changelog History

## 2.3.0

Updating dependencies to enable TensorFlow 2.5 support (and Python 3.9 overall)
Removing the destructor from the `Separator` class

## 2.2.0

Minor changes mainly fixing some issues:
* mono training was not working due to hardcoded filters in the dataset
* default argument of `separate` was of wrong type
* added a way to request spleeter version with the `--version` argument in the CLI

## 2.1.0

This version introduce design related changes, especially transition to Typer for CLI managment and Poetry as
library build backend.

* `-i` option is now deprecated and replaced by traditional CLI input argument listing
* Project is now built using Poetry
* Project requires code formatting using Black and iSort
* Dedicated GPU package `spleeter-gpu` is not supported anymore, `spleeter` package will support both CPU and GPU hardware

### API changes:

* function `get_default_audio_adapter` is now available as `default()` class method within `AudioAdapter` class
* function `get_default_model_provider` is now available as `default()` class method within `ModelProvider` class
* `STFTBackend` and `Codec` are now string enum
* `GithubModelProvider` now use `httpx` with HTTP/2 support
* Commands are now located in `__main__` module, wrapped as simple function using Typer options module provide specification for each available option and argument
* `types` module provide custom type specification and must be enhanced in future release to provide more robust typing support with MyPy
* `utils.logging` module has been cleaned, logger instance is now a module singleton, and a single function is used to configure it with verbose parameter
* Added a custom logger handler (see tiangolo/typer#203 discussion)
